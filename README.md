### Hi there! I'm Yasas Ekanayaka ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-driven individual, constantly looking to push himself out of his comfort zone to develop himself. A
quick, independent learner, willing to try new things and accept challenges. Focus areas include
Programming, web development and mobile development. I firmly believe that there are no good or bad
experiences, but only experience
